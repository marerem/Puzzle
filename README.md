# Puzzle Solver using Computer Vision - README

This GitHub repository contains code and resources for solving puzzles using computer vision techniques. The puzzle-solving process involves several steps, including puzzle detection, segmentation, classification, outlier detection, and finally, the solution of the puzzle.

## Introduction

Solving puzzles can be a challenging and fun task, but it becomes even more exciting when using computer vision techniques to automate the process. This project aims to provide a complete pipeline to solve various types of puzzles. The steps involved in the puzzle-solving process include detecting the puzzle from the background image, segmenting the puzzle pieces, classifying the pieces, detecting any outliers, and finally, solving the puzzle.

## Usage

Place the image of the puzzle you want to solve in the appropriate directory.
Open the Jupyter Notebook **project_final.ipynb** to run the puzzle solver pipeline step-by-step.
Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute each step of the puzzle-solving process.

## File Descriptions

**IAPR_Presentation_group32.pdf**: Presentation slides for the IAPR project.
**clustering.py**: Python script for clustering puzzle pieces.
**feature_extraction.py**: Python script for extracting features from puzzle pieces.
**feature_selection.py**: Python script for selecting important features for classification.
